1. Test solution if algorithms work perfectly.
2. Check astar closed list algorithm if necessary check for faster route to override it.
3. Add algorithm for testing weights starting from end to all others to find real path weights.
4. Based on that create algorithm for testing heuristic optimistic and consistency.

TODO basicly just add map that connects name of city with iterator and use that in solution for load connections
